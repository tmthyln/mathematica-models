# Models in Mathematica
Various models in the Wolfram Mathematica language (visualizations, proofs, other cool things). The models are divided according to the directory hierarchy described here:

## Classes (@UMD)
* MATH299M - projects developed as a part of the Mathematica course at UMD--some are very cool. Depending on the notebook, they may be implemented in other sub-repositories.
* STAT400 - notes and visualizations for Probability and Statistics I course at UMD--more textbook-like, but with a heavy focus on visual understanding and intuition.
* CMSC351 - notes and visualizations for Introduction to Algorithms course at UMD--also includes some code implementations (which is nice, between array indexing is consistent between the notes and the code). More notes and code than visualizations, but still some interesting ones.

## Beauty of Mathematics
* 3Blue1Brown - implementations of some visualizations in 3Blue1Brown videos (perhaps not as pretty, but more interactive)
* Linear Algebra - cool subject, with cool visual intutions. These examples were made in part to help friends visualize and understand linear algebra; they also include some ("true") multivariate calculus concepts.

## Mathematics of Computer Science
* Machine Learning - stemming from my MATH299M final project, visualizations about machine learning and deep learning
* Control Theory - stemming from a robotics seminar I taught, various visual interpretations of concepts from control theory
