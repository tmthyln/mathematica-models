# Statistics & Probability I Notes (Fall 2018 w/ John Millson)
In an effort to better understand probability and statistics (which I have always struggled with for some reason) and, to an extent, to salvage my grade, these are my notes on this subject, with descriptions, proofs, examples, visualizations, and manipulations to help nail down the subject.

Most of the content is coming from his lecture notes (currently [at the bottom of this page](https://www.math.umd.edu/~millson/teaching/STAT400fall18/stat400.html), but they will eventually have their own folder here.

## Contents
See the README for each section for detailed contents. The order presented is roughly the best order to read in (and is the order presented in Millson's notes).
### Probability
### Discrete Random Variables
### Continuous Random Variables
### Paired Random Variables
